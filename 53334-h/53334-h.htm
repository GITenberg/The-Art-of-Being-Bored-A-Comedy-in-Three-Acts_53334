<p>The author of “Le Monde où l’on s’ennuie” was
born at Paris in 1834. Besides this, his masterpiece,
he wrote numerous comedies, sentimental and satirical.
Pailleron is in no way concerned with problems
or “ideas”; he is content to depict the foibles
and affectations of society, framing his observations
into a harmonious and unified whole. This play was
first produced, at Paris, in 1881, and has since held
the stage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scenery and costumes are modern.</p>

<p>Owing to the large number of characters, some
attention must be paid to the grouping of stage pictures.
The stage-directions, if carefully followed,
will supply sufficient information to enable the
director to group the actors without difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Laughing</i>) What a scowl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Please, you mustn’t laugh out loud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> How is this, Monsieur, you are scold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>ing
me? (<i class="stage-direction">She throws herself into his arms, but he
disengages himself, terrified</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Silly! That’s enough to spoil everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh! What a bore!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Precisely! That time you struck exactly
the right note. You surely haven’t forgotten
all I told you in the train?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Why, I thought you were joking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Joking? So you don’t want to be a Prefect’s
wife?—Tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Yes, if it would please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Very well, dear. I call you dear, as we
are alone, but later on, before the guests, it must be
merely Jeanne. The Comtesse de Céran has done
me the honor of asking me to introduce my young
wife to her, and of spending a few days here at her
château. Mme. de Céran’s circle is one of the
three or four most influential in Paris. We are not
here to amuse ourselves. I come here merely a
Sub-prefect; I am determined to leave a Prefect.
Everything depends on her—upon us—upon you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Upon me? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Of course, on you! Society judges a man
by his wife, and society is right. Therefore be on
your guard.—Dignity without pride: a knowing
smile—ears and eyes open, lips closed! Oh, compliments,
as many as you like, and quotations, short
and authoritative: for philosophy try Hegel; for
literature, Jean Paul; politics——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But I don’t understand politics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Here all the women talk politics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Well, I know nothing whatever about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Neither do they, but that doesn’t make
any difference. Cite Pufendorff and Machiavelli as
if they were your own relatives, and talk about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Council of Trent as if you had presided over it. As
for your amusements: music, strolls in the garden,
and whist—that’s all I can allow. Your
clothes must be chosen with great care, and as for
Latin—use the few words I’ve taught you. In a
week’s time I want it to be said of you: “Ah, that
little Mme. Raymond will be the wife of a Cabinet
Minister some day!” And in this circle, you know,
when they say that a woman will be a Cabinet Minister’s
wife, her husband is not very far from a
portfolio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What? Do you want to be Minister?—Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> In order to keep from becoming famous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But Mme. de Céran belongs to the opposition;
what can you expect from her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> How simple you are! In the matter of
political positions, there is only the slightest shade
of difference between the Conservatives and their
opponents: the Conservatives ask for places and
their opponents accept them. No, no, my child,
this is the place where reputations are made and unmade
and made over again; where, under the appearance
of talking literature and art, Machiavellian
conspirators hatch their schemes: this is the private
entrance to the ministries, the antechamber of
the Academies, the laboratory of success!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Heavens! What sort of circle is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> It is the 1881 edition of the Hotel de
Rambouillet: a section of society where everybody
talks and poses, where pedantry masquerades as
knowledge, sentimentality as sentiment, and preciosity
as delicacy and refinement;—here no one ever
dreams of saying what one thinks, and never believes
what one says, where friendship is a matter
of cold calculation, and chivalry and manners
merely means to an end. It is where one swallows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
one’s tongue in the drawing-room just as one leaves
one’s cane in the hallway: in short, Society where
one learns the art of being serious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> I should say, the art of being bored!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Precisely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But if everyone bores everyone else,
what possible influence can it all have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> What influence? How simple you are!
You ask what influence can boredom exert, here in
this country? A great deal, I tell you. You see,
the Frenchman has a horror of boredom amounting
almost to veneration. <i lang="fr">Ennui</i> is for him a terrible
god whose worship is celebrated by good form. He
recognizes nothing as serious unless it is in regulation
dress. I don’t say that he practises what he
preaches, but that is only a further reason for believing
more firmly: he prefers believing to finding
out for himself. I tell you, this nation, which is at
bottom gay, despises itself for being so; it has forgotten
its faith in the good common sense of its
generous laughter; this sceptical and talkative nation
believes in those who have little to say, this
whole-hearted and amiable people allows itself to be
imposed upon by pedantic false pride and the pretentious
asininity of the pontiffs of the white dress
necktie: in politics, in science, in art, in literature,
in everything! These they scoff at, hate, flee as
from a pestilence, yet they alone preserve for these
things a secret admiration and perfect confidence!
And you ask what influence has boredom? Ah, my
dear girl, there are just two kinds of people in the
world: those who don’t know how to bore themselves,
and who are nobodies; and those who know
how to bore themselves, and who are somebody—besides
those who know how to bore others!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> And this is the place you’ve brought
me to!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Do you want to be a Prefect’s wife? Tell
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, to begin with, I could never——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh, never mind! It’s only for a week!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> A week! Without speaking, without
laughing, without being kissed by you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> That’s before company; but when we are
alone—in the dark, oh, then! Why, it will be delightful;
we’ll arrange secret meetings, in the garden,
everywhere—just as we did before we were
married—at your father’s, do you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Very well, very well! (<i class="stage-direction">She opens the
piano and plays an air from La Fille de Madame
Angot</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Terrified</i>) Very well, then! What are
you doing there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> It’s from the opera we saw last night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> My poor child, so this is the way you follow
my advice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> We sat in a box together—wasn’t it
lovely, Paul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Jeanne! Jeanne!—What if someone
should come in! Please!</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Francois</span> <i class="stage-direction">appears at the back</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Too late! (<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">changes the air she
was playing into a Beethoven Symphony. Aside</i>)
Beethoven,—Bravo! (<i class="stage-direction">He listens to the music with
profound satisfaction</i>) Ah, it’s a fact that the only
place for music is the <i lang="fr">Conservatoire</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> Madame la Comtesse requests Monsieur
le sous-préfet to wait five minutes for her: she
is in consultation with Monsieur le baron Eriel de
Saint-Réault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> The Orientalist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> I do not know, Monsieur, he is the
son of the scientist whose father was so talented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) Who has so many positions
to dispose of! He’s the one!—Ah, M. de Saint-Réault
is here, then. I presume Mme. de Saint-Réault
is with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> Yes, M. le sous-préfet; likewise the
Marquise de Loudan and Mme. Arriégo, but these
ladies are at present in Paris, following M. Bellac’s
course—with Mlle. Suzanne de Villiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> There are no other guests here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> There is Madame la duchesse de Réville,
Madame’s aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> I don’t refer to the Duchess or to Miss
Watson; or to Mlle. de Villiers: they are the family!
I mean guests, like ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> No, M. le sous-préfet, there are no
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> And no one else is expected?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> Oh, yes, M. le sous-préfet; M. Roger,
the son of Mme. la comtesse, has just arrived to-day
from his scientific investigations in the Orient.
He is expected any moment.—Ah, and then M. Bellac,
the professor, who is to spend a few days here
when his lecture course is over—at least we hope
so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) Ah, that’s why there are so
many ladies!—Very well, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> Then M. le sous-préfet will be good
enough to wait?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Yes, and tell Mme. la comtesse not to
hurry. (<span class="smcap">Francois</span> <i class="stage-direction">goes out</i>) Whew! You gave
me a turn with that music! But you got out of it
beautifully, changing Lecocq to Beethoven! Rather
good, that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Stupid, am I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> I know better now! We still have five
minutes; I’ll tell you a little about these people: it’s
best to be on the safe side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, never mind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Come, Jeanne, five minutes! You <em>must</em>
know something about them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> After each “something” you must kiss
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> All right, then; what a child you are! I
won’t be long: mother, son, friend, and guest,—everyone
of them very serious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> How amusing that will be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Don’t worry, there are two who are not
so serious. I have kept them for the last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> One moment, please, pay me first!
(<i class="stage-direction">She counts on her fingers</i>) Madame de Céran, one;
her son Roger, two; Miss Lucy, three; the two
Saint-Réault; one Bellac, one Loudan and one Arriégo,
that makes eight! (<i class="stage-direction">She puts her cheek up
to be kissed</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Eight what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Eight “somethings“—pay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> <em>What</em> a child! There, there, there! (<i class="stage-direction">He
kisses her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Not so fast: retail, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">After having kissed her more slowly</i>)
There, does that satisfy you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> For the present. Now, let’s have the
two who are not serious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> First, the Duchesse de Réville, the aunt,
a handsome old lady who was a beauty in her
day——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Questioningly</i>) Hmm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> So they say! A bit brusque and direct—but
an excellent lady and very sensible—as you’ll
see. But last and best, Suzanne de Villiers! She,
is not at all serious—it’s a fault with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> At last, somebody who’s frivolous,
thank Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Girl of eighteen, a tom-boy, chatter-box,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
free with her tongue and her manners—with a life-history
that reads like a novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Umm! Lovely, let’s hear it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> She’s the daughter of a certain widow—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Well? Daughter of a widow—and that
ass Georges de Villiers, another nephew of the
Duchess; she adored him. A natural child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Natural? How lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> The mother and father are dead. The
child was left an orphan at the age of twelve with
a princely heritage and an education to match.
Georges taught her Javanese. The Duchess, who
adores her, brought her into the home of Madame
de Céran, who detests her, and gave her Roger
for a tutor. They tried their best to keep her in
a convent, but she ran away twice; they sent her
back a third time and—here she is again! Imagine
that state of affairs! And that’s the end of the
story—good, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> So good that you needn’t pay me the
two kisses you owe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Disappointed</i>) Ohh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But I’ll pay you! (<i class="stage-direction">She kisses him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Silly! (<i class="stage-direction">The door at the back opens</i>)
Oh! Saint-Réault and Madame de Céran! No, she
didn’t see us. Now—ahem—ready!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span> <i class="stage-direction">and</i> <span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>. <i class="stage-direction">They
pause in the doorway, not seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i class="stage-direction">and</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> No, no, no, my friend, not the
first poll! Listen to me, 15-8-15 the first poll—— There
was a secret ballot on that one and therefore
on the second: it’s very simple!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> Simple? Simple? Now the
second poll, since I have only four votes on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
second poll, with our nine votes on the first poll—that
leaves us only thirteen on the second!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> And our seven on the first—that
makes twenty on the second! Don’t you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Enlightened</i>) Ahhh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) Very simple!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I repeat, beware of Dalibert
and his Liberals. At present the Academy is Liberal—at
present—at present! (<i class="stage-direction">They come down-stage,
talking</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> Isn’t Revel also the leader of
the New School?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at him</i>) Ohh! Revel
isn’t dead yet, is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> He isn’t ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Slightly embarrassed</i>) Oh, he’s
always in poor health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Well, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> We must always be prepared,
mustn’t we?—I’ll keep my eyes open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) There’s something at
the bottom of all this! (<i class="stage-direction">Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Raymond</span>, <i class="stage-direction">and going
toward him</i>) Ah, my dear Monsieur Raymond,
I was forgetting all about you; pardon me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> My dear Countess! (<i class="stage-direction">Presenting</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>)
Madame Paul Raymond!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You are most welcome here,
Madame! Consider yourself in the home of a
friend. (<i class="stage-direction">Presenting them to</i> <span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>) Monsieur
Paul Raymond, Sub-prefect of Agenis, Madame
Paul Raymond, Monsieur le baron Eriel de
Saint-Réault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> I am especially happy to make your acquaintance
since, as a young man, it was my privilege
to know your illustrious father. (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) He
stuck me on my final examinations!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Bowing</i>) What a pleasant coincidence,
M. le Préfet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Especially pleasant for me, M. le Baron!</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span> <i class="stage-direction">goes to the table and writes</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You will find my house a
trifle austere for a person of your youth, Madame.
You have only your husband to blame for your stay
here.—It has its moments of monotony, but you may
console yourself with the thought that resignation
means obedience, and that in coming here you had
no choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Gravely</i>) As regards that, Mme. la
comtesse, “To be free is not to do what one wishes,
but what one judges to be best”—as the philosopher
Joubert has said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking approvingly at</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>)
That is quite reassuring, my dear. But I think you
will find that no matter how intellectual our circle
may be, it is not lacking in <i lang="fr">esprit</i>. Indeed this very
evening you will find the <i lang="fr">soirée</i> particularly interesting.
Monsieur de Saint-Réault has been kind
enough to offer to read to us from his unpublished
work on Rama-Ravana and the Sanscrit Legends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Really! Oh, Jeanne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> How fortunate we are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> After which I believe I can
promise you something from Monsieur Bellac.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> The Professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What woman doesn’t? How delightful
that will be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> An informal talk—<i class="stage-direction">ad usum
mundi</i>—a few words, gems of wisdom; and finally,
the reading of an unpublished play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh! In verse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The first work of a young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
—an unknown poet, who is to be introduced to me
this evening and whose play has just been accepted
by the Théâtre-Francais.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> How fortunate we are to be able to enjoy
among these charming people another of these
wonderful opportunities that one finds nowhere except
beneath your roof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Doesn’t this literary atmosphere
frighten you, Madame? Your charms will be
wasted at a <i lang="fr">soirée</i> like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Seriously</i>) “What appears a waste
to the vulgar is often a gain”—as M. de Tocqueville
has said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at her in astonishment—aside
to</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) She is charming! (<span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>
<i class="stage-direction">rises, and goes toward the door</i>) Saint-Réault,
where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">As he goes</i>) To the station—a
telegram. Excuse me—I’ll be back in ten minutes.
(<i class="stage-direction">He goes out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> There is certainly something at
the bottom of all this! (<i class="stage-direction">She looks among the papers
on the table—to</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">and</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) I beg your
pardon! (<i class="stage-direction">She rings, and after a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Francois</span>
<i class="stage-direction">appears</i>) The papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francois.</span> M. de Saint-Réault took them away
this morning. They are in his room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Drawing Le Journal Amusant from his
pocket</i>) If you wish the——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Quickly checking him and at the same
time producing the Journal des Debats<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> from her
pocket and offering it to</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span>) This is
to-day’s paper, Countess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> With pleasure—I am curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
about—please pardon me again! (<i class="stage-direction">She opens the
paper and reads</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To his wife</i>) Bravo! Keep it up! The
Joubert was excellent and the de Tocqueville—I
say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> It wasn’t de Tocqueville—it was <em>I</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Reading</i>) “Revel very ill.”
Just what I thought. Saint-Réault isn’t losing
much time. (<i class="stage-direction">Handing the paper to</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) I
found out what I wanted to know, thank you. But
I shan’t keep you, you shall be shown to your
rooms. We dine sharp at six; you know the Duchess
is very punctual. At four tea is served; at five
we take a stroll and at six have dinner. (<i class="stage-direction">The clock
strikes four</i>) Ah, four already, and here she is!
(<i class="stage-direction">The</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i class="stage-direction">enters, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Francois</span>, <i class="stage-direction">who
brings her chair and her work-basket. A maid brings
tea. The</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i class="stage-direction">sits in the chair placed for her</i>)
My dear Aunt, allow me to present——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Settling herself</i>) Wait a minute—wait
a minute. There! Present whom? (<i class="stage-direction">She looks
through her lorgnette</i>) It isn’t Raymond that you
want to present, is it? I’ve known him for a long
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Advancing with</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) No, Duchess,
but Madame Paul Raymond, his wife,—if you
please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Gazing at</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>, <i class="stage-direction">who bows</i>) She’s
pretty—very pretty! With my Suzanne, and Lucy,
despite her glasses, that makes three pretty women
in my house—and heaven knows that’s not too
many! (<i class="stage-direction">She drinks</i>) And how on earth did a
charming girl like you happen to marry that awful
Republican?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Chaffingly</i>) Oh, Duchess, I a Republican!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Well, you were one, at least! (<i class="stage-direction">She
drinks again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh, well, like everyone else, when I was
little. That is the measles of politics, Duchess,
everybody has to have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Laughing</i>) Ah, oh, ah, the measles!
Isn’t he funny! (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) And you, my dear,
you like a joke once in a while, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, Duchess, I have no objection to a
little frivolity—in moderation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> That isn’t very frivolous, but it’s better
than nothing. Well, well—I like a little frivolity
myself, especially in a person of your age.
(<i class="stage-direction">To the maid</i>) Here, take this away. (<i class="stage-direction">She hands
her cup to the maid</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To the maid</i>) Will you show
Madame Raymond to her room, Mademoiselle? (<i class="stage-direction">To</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) Your room is this way, just next to
mine——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Thank you, Madame. (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>)
Come, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Oh, no, I have put your husband
over there on the other side, among the workers:
my son, the Count and Monsieur Bellac, in
the Pavilion, which we call—a little pretentiously,
perhaps—the Pavillion of the Muses. (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>)
Francois will show you the way. I thought you
would be able to work better there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Admirable arrangement, Countess; I
thank you. (<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">pinches him</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sweetly</i>) Go, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to her</i>) You’ll come at least and
help me unpack my trunks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> How can I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Through the upper corridor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span>) If you think
it pleases those two to separate them like that——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) I’ve gone too far!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) Aren’t you
pleased with this arrangement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Perfectly, Madame la comtesse; and
you know better than anyone else <i lang="la">quid deceat, quid
non</i>. (<i class="stage-direction">She bows</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) She is perfectly
charming!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">They go out</i>; <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i class="stage-direction">right</i>, <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">left</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Seated near the table at the left,
working at her fancy-work</i>) Ah, she knows Latin!
She ought to be congenial to the company!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You know Revel is very ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> He is never anything else,—what’s
that to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sitting down</i>) What do you
mean, Aunt? Revel is a second Saint-Réault. He
holds at least fifteen positions: leader of the New
School, for instance—a position which leads to any
number of others! Just the thing for Roger. He
returns to-day, and I’ve asked the Minister’s secretary
to dinner this evening, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, a new one: Toulonnier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I take away his position from
him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> So you want to make your son the
leader of a school?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> It’ll be another stepping-stone,
you know, Aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> You have brought him up to be a
mere chess-pawn, haven’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I have made of him a serious-minded
man, Aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, I should think so! A man of
twenty-eight, who has never—done a foolish thing
in his life, I’ll wager! It’s a perfect shame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> At thirty he will enter the In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>stitute,
and at thirty-five the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> So you want to begin again with your
son, and do with him as you did with his father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Did I make so miserable a
failure of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I say nothing about your husband: a
dryasdust creature, with a mediocre intellect—!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Aunt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Of course, your husband was a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Duchess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> A fool who happened to know how to
behave himself! You forced him into politics,
you’ll admit that. And then, all you could make of
him was Minister of Agriculture and Commerce.
That isn’t much to boast about. But enough of
him; Roger’s another matter: he has brains and
spirit enough—or will have, God willing—or he’s
no nephew of mine. That never occurred to you,
did it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I am thinking of his career.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And his happiness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I have thought of that, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Ah, yes! Lucy, eh? They correspond,
I know that. That’s fine! A young girl who wears
glasses and has a neck like a——! And you call
that thinking of his happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Duchess, you are quite incorrigible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> A sort of meteorite, who fell among
us, intending to stop two weeks, and remained
two years: a blue-stocking who writes letters to
scholars and translates Schopenhauer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> A rich, intellectual, highly-educated
and well-born orphan, niece of the Lord-Chancellor,
who recommended her: she would be a
splendid wife for Roger, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> That English iceberg? Brrrr! Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
to kiss her would freeze the nose off his face! But
you’re on a false scent. In the first place Bellac
has his eye on her—yes, the Professor! He’s asked
me too many questions about her to leave any doubt
in my mind. And what is more, she seems fond of
<em>him</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, Lucy,—like all the rest of you!
You’re all mad over him. I know more about this
than you do.—No, no! Lucy is not the woman for
your son!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I know your schemes: Suzanne
is the woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I don’t deny it. I have brought Suzanne
here for that very purpose. I arranged that
he should be her tutor and her master, so to speak,
in order that he might marry her,—and marry her
he shall!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You have counted without me,
Duchess; I shall never consent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And why not? A girl who——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Is of questionable origin, questionable
attraction, without education and manners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Bursting into laughter</i>) My living
image at her age!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Without fortune! Without
family!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Without family? The daughter of
my poor Georges? My handsome, good, kind
Georges!—And she’s your cousin after all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> A natural child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Natural? Aren’t all children natural?
You amuse me! She’s been legally recognized!
And good heavens, when the devil’s put his finger
in the pie why shouldn’t the rest of us? Me,
too, eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The devil has put his finger in
the pie, but not the way you think. <em>You</em> are on the
false scent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Oh, the Professor! Yes, Bellac. You
told me that. You think no woman can follow his
lectures without falling in love with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> But Suzanne hasn’t missed a
single lecture, Aunt, and she takes notes and corrects
them and copies them—I tell you Suzanne is
in earnest. And while he is speaking she never
takes her eyes off him; she drinks in every word.
And you think that is all for the sake of science!
Nonsense, it isn’t the science she loves, it’s the
scientist. That is as plain as day. You have only
to watch her when she’s with Lucy. She is dreadfully
jealous. And this recently acquired coquetry
in a girl of her disposition—! She sighs, sulks,
blushes, turns pale, laughs, cries——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> April showers! She’s just coming
into bloom. She’s bored, poor child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Here? Do you think it’s amusing
here? Do you suppose that if <em>I</em> were eighteen, I
should be here, among all your old ladies and your
old gentlemen? I should say not! I’d associate
with young people all the time; the younger the
better, the handsomer the better, the more admirers
I had the better! There are only two things that
women never grow weary of: loving and being
loved! And the older I grow the more I realize
that there is no other happiness in the world!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> There are more serious things
in life than that, Duchess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"> Duchess.</span> More serious than love? Nonsense!
Do you mean to say that when that is gone, there
is any other happiness left? When we are old, we
have false pleasures, just as we have false teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
but there is only one true happiness, and that is
love, love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Oh, Aunt, you are too romantic!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> The fault of my years! Women find
romance but twice in their lives: at sixteen in their
own hearts, at sixty in the hearts of others. Well,
you want your son to marry Lucy; I want him to
marry Suzanne. You say Suzanne is in love with
Bellac; I say, <span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Perhaps we are both wrong;
it is for Roger to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I shall explain the whole situation to
him the moment he arrives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Do you intend——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> He is her tutor! (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) He must
know.</p>



<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">In a low-cut evening gown</i>) I believe
your son has arrived, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The Count!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Roger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> His carriage has just come into the court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> At last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Were you afraid he wouldn’t return?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I feared he would not return
in time. I was anxious about that place for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, he wrote me this morning that he
would return to-day, Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And you missed one of the Professor’s
lectures in order to see him that much sooner.
Hm, that’s lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> That wasn’t the reason, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span>) You see?—No?
Why then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No, I was looking for—I—it was another
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I don’t suppose it is for that Schopenhauer
gentleman you are all dressed up like that,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Is there not to be company this evening,
Madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span>) Bellac,
that’s as plain as day! (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) Let me congratulate
you, then. I have nothing to complain of,
except those frightful glasses. Why do you wear
such awful things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Because I cannot see without them, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> A nice reason! (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) Isn’t she
practical! I detest practical people! She’ll pass,
she’s not as thin as I thought she was! These English
occasionally disappoint one pleasantly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Ah, here’s my son!</p>



<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roger.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Mother! Mother! How good it is to see
you again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> How good it is to see you, my
dear! (<i class="stage-direction">She holds out her hand, which he kisses</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> What a long while it is since I’ve seen
you!—Once more! (<i class="stage-direction">He kisses her hand again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) That embrace wouldn’t
smother anyone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The Duchess, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Approaching the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>) Duchess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Call me Aunt, and give me a kiss!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> My dear Aunt! (<i class="stage-direction">He starts to kiss her
hand</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> No! No! On the cheek! You must
kiss me on the cheek! That is one of the privileges
of age—Look at him now! Same little fellow
as ever! Oh, you’ve let your moustache grow;
isn’t he charming!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I hope, Roger, you will shave
that off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Don’t let it disturb you, Mother, I shall
do it at once!—Ah, how do you do, Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How do you do, Roger? (<i class="stage-direction">They shake
hands</i>) Have you had a pleasant trip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh, most interesting. Think of it, an
almost unexplored country, a veritable paradise
for the scholar, the poet, and the artist—but I wrote
you all about that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sitting down</i>) Tell me about the
women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Duchess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Astonished</i>) What women do you
mean, Aunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Why, the Oriental women they say are
so beautiful. Ah, you villain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Let me assure you, Aunt, I had no time
to investigate that—detail!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Indignantly</i>) Detail, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Smiling</i>) Besides, the Government did
not send me there for that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> What did you see, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> You will find that in the <i>Revue Archéologique</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> <i>Tombs of Eastern Asia</i>; isn’t that the subject,
Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Yes, Lucy; now among those mounds—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Ah, the mounds—those <i>Tumuli</i>——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Come, come, you can chatter when
you two are alone! Tell me, aren’t you tired? Did
you just arrive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh, no, Aunt. I’ve been in Paris since
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Did you go to the theater last night,
Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, I went at once to see the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Good! And what did he have
to say to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I’ll leave you alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You needn’t go, <span class="smcap">Lucy.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, I think I ought to go. I shall return
in a few minutes. I’ll see you later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Taking her hand</i>) Until later, Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) There’s a grand passion indeed!</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i class="stage-direction">goes out</i>. <span class="smcap">Roger</span> <i class="stage-direction">accompanies her as far as

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Now, let’s hear what the Minister
had to say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Ah, yes! Let’s hear. We’re anxious
to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> He questioned me as to the results of my
trip and asked me to submit my report as soon as
possible, promising me a reward on the day it was
handed in. You can guess what that reward will
be. (<i class="stage-direction">He touches the lapel of his coat, as if to show
the ribbon of the Legion of Honor</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Officer? That’s all very well,
but I have something better. And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Then he asked me to convey to you his
kindest regards, and begged you keep him in mind
when that law came up for consideration by the
Senate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I shall keep him in mind if he
keeps me in mind.—You must set to work on your
report at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Immediately!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Did you leave cards for the
Speaker of the House?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Yes, this morning, and for General de
Briais and Mme. de Vielfond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Good! It must be known that
you have returned. I’ll have a paragraph sent to the
papers.—And one thing more: those articles you
sent back from the East were very good. But I
noticed with astonishment a tendency toward—what
shall I say?—imagination, “fine” writing; descriptions,
irrelevancies—even poetry—(<i class="stage-direction">Reproachfully</i>)
Alfred de Musset, my son!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, the article was most interesting:
you must be more careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The Duchess is joking, my
dear. But be careful about poetry; never do it
again! You are concerned with serious subjects;
you must be serious yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But I had no idea, Mother!—How can
you tell when an article is serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Holding up a pamphlet</i>) When the
pages aren’t cut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Your Aunt exaggerates, but
take my advice: no more poetry!—And now, dinner
at six. You have an hour to work on your report.
I shan’t keep you any longer. Go to work, my
dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Just a moment! Now that this tender
and affecting scene is over let us talk business, if
you please. What about Suzanne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh, the dear child! Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Attending a course of lectures on
Comparative Literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne?!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, Bellac’s course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Bellac, who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> One of this winter’s crop! The season’s
fad in scholars. A gallant knight from the
Normal School, who makes love to the ladies, is
made love to by them—and consequently makes a
comfortable living. The Princess Okolitch, who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
mad about him, like all the old ladies, conceived
the idea of having him deliver a course of lectures
in her salon, with literature as an excuse, and gossip
as a result. It appears that your pupil, having
seen all these grand ladies smitten with this young,
amiable, and loquacious genius, has followed in the
footsteps of her elders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> It is no use, Duchess——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I beg your pardon; Roger is her tutor
and he ought to know everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But what does all this mean, Aunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> It means that Suzanne is in love with
this gentleman; now do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne! That child! Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> It doesn’t take so long for a child to
change into a woman, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Well, at least that is what your mother
says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I say that that young lady is
openly courting favor with a man much too serious
to marry her, but gallant enough to amuse her, and
to have this going on under my own roof,—though
it isn’t as yet scandalous—is decidedly improper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Do you hear that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But, Mother, you surprise me! Suzanne,
a little child I left in short dresses, climbing trees,
a child I used to punish with extra lessons, who
used to jump on my knee and call me Daddy—— Come,
come! It is impossible! Such demoralization
at her age!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Demoralization? Because she is in
love! You are a true son of your mother, if there
ever was one! At “her age”! You ought to have
seen me when I was that old! There was a hussar,
in a blue and silver uniform! He was superb! His
brains were all in his sword-hilt! But at my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
age—! A young heart is like a new land: the discoverer
is seldom the ruler. Now it seems—this
Bellac—oh, it doesn’t seem possible, and yet—young
girls, you know—- We must take care! (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>)
I don’t believe a word of it, but I’ll be on my guard!—And
that is why I want you to do me the favor
of burying your <i>Tumuli</i> and giving your attention to
her, and her alone.</p>


<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Stealing up behind</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>, <i class="stage-direction">puts her

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Rising</i>) Ehh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Stepping in front of him</i>) Here I
am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Surprised</i>) But,—Mademoiselle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Naughty man! Not to recognize your
own daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) He’s blushing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Well, aren’t you going to kiss me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Suzanne, that’s not quite the
thing——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> To kiss your father? The idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Kiss her, why don’t
you!</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Suzanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">and</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span> <i class="stage-direction">kiss</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> How happy I am! Just think, I had
no idea you were coming home to-day! Mme. de
Saint-Réault told me just now at the lecture; so,
without saying a word—I was right near the door—I
whisked out and ran to the station!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Yes, all alone! Oh, it was fun! The
funniest part—wait till I tell you! When I got to
the ticket office I found I didn’t have a sou, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
what do you think?—a gentleman who was buying
his ticket offered to buy one for me. Oh, he was
a very nice young man! He happened to be going
to St. Germain, too, and when he offered to buy my
ticket, another man offered, too: a respectable-looking
old gentleman,—and then another—and after
him, any number of others, who were standing
there. They were all going to St. Germain. “But,
Mademoiselle, I beg you—I really cannot allow you
to——” “Allow me—no, me,—I beg you, Mademoiselle!”
I let the old respectable gentleman buy
the ticket—for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> You allowed him to——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I couldn’t very well stay where I was,
could I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> From a perfect stranger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But he was such a respectable old
gentleman! And he was very nice to me! He
helped me into the train. So nice of him! Of
course, all the rest were, too; <em>they</em> all got into the
compartment with us.—And it was so jolly! Such
fun! They offered me their places, every one!
They opened the window for me, and then fell all
over themselves being nice to me! “This way,
Mademoiselle! Not there, you’ll be in the sun!”
And they pulled down their cuffs, and twirled their
moustaches, and bowed and scraped as if I’d been
some grand lady—Oh, it’s fun to go by yourself!
And the respectable old gentleman kept talking all
the time about his immense estates, but what did I
care about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Why, this is outrageous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But the funniest thing of all was
when we arrived, I found my purse in my pocket;
I paid the respectable old gentleman for the ticket,
made a pretty curtsey to the other gentlemen, and
then I ran off. Oh, you should have seen how they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
all looked at me! (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Just as you do now!
Why, what’s the matter? Kiss me again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>) There’s an
impropriety even worse than the rest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Impropriety!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> You see, she’s perfectly innocent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> A young girl traveling alone
in a train!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Doesn’t Lucy go out alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Lucy is not a girl of sixteen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> No: she’ll never see twenty-four
again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Lucy is able to take care of
herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Why? Because of those glasses of
hers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Laughing</i>) Now, Suzanne! (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>)
I adore that girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Lucy wasn’t expelled from the
convent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> That isn’t fair, and you know it! I
was so bored—!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Your tutor knows——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But he doesn’t know why—you’ll see
if it wasn’t unfair. When I used to get bored in
class, I sat near the door leading into the garden.
Oh, it was so easy! I had a clever plan! When
everything was as quiet as could be, I shouted at
the top of my voice, “Long live the great Voltaire!”
Sister Séraphine at once ordered me to leave the
room. It was perfectly simple, and it only took a
moment. One day when the sun was shining beautifully,
I was looking out of the window, and all at
once I shouted, “Long live Voltaire!” I listened,
there was no answer. I shouted again, “Voltaire!”
Silence again! Very much surprised, I turned
around: the Mother Superior was there: I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>n’t
heard her come in! Tableau! But she didn’t send
me into the garden, oh, no! She sent me here! I
didn’t care! I had had enough of that convent life.—I’m
a woman now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Your conduct fails to reveal
the fact.—Mme. de Saint-Réault must be very anxious
about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, the lecture was almost over: she
will be here in a moment, with M. Bellac and the
others. Oh, his lecture to-day——!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Hm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> And the way those women applauded!
And the crowd! And what wonderful gowns! It
was like a wedding at Ste. Clotilde! It was—(<i class="stage-direction">Throwing
a kiss</i>) superb!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Hm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Superb! You ought to have heard
those women! “Charming, charming!” Madame
de Loudan was squeaking like a Guinea-pig. Ugh,
ugh! I detest that woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Hm! (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Suzanne</span>)
Are those the notes you took at the lectures?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, I take others besides. (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>)
You’ll see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>, <i class="stage-direction">picking up the notebook
from the table, where</i> <span class="smcap">Suzanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">had left it on entering</i>)
Well, let’s see—(<i class="stage-direction">The clock strikes five</i>) Oh,
and my walk! (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) Now you understand
Bellac’s role in this matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Examine it, study it,—it’s a manuscript
worth your while deciphering; that’s your
profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I don’t understand anything about this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> It is your duty, you know, as her
tutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) That’s a waste of
time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside, looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) That has
waked him up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside, looking at all of them</i>) What
are they all up to?</p>

<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">The</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span> <i class="stage-direction">and</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span> <i class="stage-direction">go out</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Why do you stare at me? Because I
went out alone? Are you angry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, Suzanne, but you ought to know better
than to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Are you angry with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, only——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Then it’s because you consider me a
woman now, is it? Do you? Tell me, I want so
much to know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Yes, you are a woman now, and it is for
that very reason that we must respect the conventions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Snuggling up to him</i>) Scold me, I
love to hear you, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Gently pushing her away</i>) There now,
stay over there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> So you don’t want me to call you
“dear,” either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> It would be better not to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> That isn’t easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> And there are other questions of propriety
which you must consider. That is exactly
what I was objecting to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, yes, I know, I have no manners.
M. Bellac is never tired of telling me so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Ah, Monsieur——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But what can you expect? There is
no help for it! It’s not my fault, I tell you, it’s
not my fault. It is not so easy as you think; I made
a vow with myself that when you came back you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
would find me just as formal as Lucy, that I would
wear myself out learning!—Here I’ve been studying
six months—and then all of a sudden you appear
and, whist—there goes six months’ work for
nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Reproachfully</i>) For nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, how glad I am you’ve come! Oh,
how I love you! I adore you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne, Suzanne! I beg of you not to
use words that you cannot possibly understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> What? That I don’t understand? I
tell you I adore you! You, you funny old thing,
don’t you love me, too? Why are you so funny?
Do you love me better than Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Are you sure? You’re not going to
marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Suzanne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> They told me you were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Then why do you write to her?—Oh,
I know; you’ve written twenty-seven letters to
her—I’ve counted them, twenty-seven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Those were nothing but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> And one more this morning. Were
they all “nothing buts”? What was in that letter
that came this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I merely wrote that I should arrive on
Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> That you would arrive on Thursday?
Was that all, really? But why didn’t you write to
me? Then I’d have been the first to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But haven’t I written to you—often?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Often? Ten times. And then nothing
but little insignificant notes at the bottom of
someone else’s letter—the kind you’d write to a
baby. I’m not a baby any longer: I’ve been think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>ing
a lot these last six months; I’ve learned a heap
of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> What have you learned? (<span class="smcap">Suzanne</span>
<i class="stage-direction">leans against his shoulder and cries</i>) Why, Suzanne,
what’s wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Wiping her eyes and trying to laugh</i>)
And then I’ve worked—! Oh, how I worked!
Piano, that horrid piano—I’m up to Schumann now,
that’s proper enough, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Shall I play you something of his?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Not now, later!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> All right.—And I’ve learned so much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> You are attending Professor Bellac’s lectures,
aren’t you? So he’s taken my place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Yes, he’s been so nice! I love him,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Are you jealous of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Tell me if you are; I’ll understand.
I’m so jealous! But why should <em>you</em> be? You’re
my father, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh, your father——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> What’s wrong? Be nice to me, the
way you used to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> The way I used to? Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Yes, the way you used to! (<i class="stage-direction">She attempts
to embrace him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, no, no, Suzanne, don’t do that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Come now, that’s enough! Run away
now! (<i class="stage-direction">Sits on the sofa</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I like you that way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Be a little bit reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, we’ve had enough reasonableness
for to-day. (<i class="stage-direction">She ruffles his hair, laughing</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Run away, now! A big girl like you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Jealously</i>) If I were only Lucy——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Now, now! Please, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> There, you said “dear.” Forfeit!
(<i class="stage-direction">She sits on his knee and kisses him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> All right, again! (<i class="stage-direction">She kisses him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Repulsing her as he rises</i>) This is too
much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I’m an awful tease, am I not? Well,
I’ll get my notebooks for you: they’ll calm us
down a little. (<i class="stage-direction">She stops in the doorway and looks
at him</i>) Oh, here are the ladies and M. Bellac!
What! Lucy in an evening gown? Wait one moment!
(<i class="stage-direction">She runs out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Agitated</i>) This is decidedly too much!</p>



<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> How excited you look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> You see, she was so affectionate—too
affectionate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, I advise you to complain! See
what I have found! (<i class="stage-direction">She takes a mounted photograph
from between the leaves of</i> <span class="smcap">Suzanne’s</span> <i class="stage-direction">notebook</i>)</p>

What delicacy of imagination!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> With such an audience, who could not

come, we must defend ourselves! Help me. Come
to the rescue, Lucy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> She will not help you, Marquise; she

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> That would be robbing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
soul of its most precious possession: according to
you, then, Lucy, nothing is good, or bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Coldly</i>) There is no question about good

There is no other word for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> Ah, Baron, Baron, what a

are these first stammering professions of primitive

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>) Pardon my boldness,
Monsieur, but in your enumeration of the

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Réault.</span> But those are not the Sacred
Books, they are merely poems whose ancient origin

They are works of literature, merely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But nevertheless, the Academy of Calcutta——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint-Réault.</span> I merely give you the opinion

<p><span class="smcap">Toulonnier.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>) Very learned

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> We were almost caught before dinner.
Twice would be too much! I don’t want to risk
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Didn’t you promise to kiss me every

Really, Jeanne, you prefer the <i lang="sa">Bhagavata</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, the <i lang="sa">Bhagavata</i>, my dear——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Did you understand any of
that mass of erudition, Madame? Poor Saint-Réault
seemed particularly wordy and obscure this evening!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) The jealous rival!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But towards the end, Countess, he was
clear enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Ah, yes, about his candidacy;
you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Well, after all, if faith requires science
to support it, has not science some need of faith?—as
Monsieur de Maistre has said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Very good indeed! I must introduce
you to a gentleman who will be very useful
to you: General de Briais, the Senator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> And how about the Deputy, Countess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Oh, the Senator is more powerful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But the Deputy is more active!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Really, my dear Raymond,
you are very fortunate. (<i class="stage-direction">Pressing</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne’s</span> <i class="stage-direction">hand</i>)
And so am I! (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) Good—I’ll introduce
you to both!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Following</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>, <i class="stage-direction">who follows</i> <span class="smcap">Mme.

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Aren’t we going where it’s dark pretty
soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Yes, my angel, but wait until the rest are

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Young?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I know nothing whatsoever
about him, but I am assured that this is his first

the <i lang="fr">Conservateur</i>? They should have been here at
nine. I can’t imagine what keeps them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> I shall profit by the circumstance, for
I came to see neither scholar nor poet. I came to
see <em>him</em>, my dear: Bellac! Think of it, I’ve never
met him! He is so attractive, they tell me! Princess
Okolitch is quite mad about him, you know.
Where is he? Oh, show him to me, Countess!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

Well, did you hear, Aunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes, but I saw nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> It was certainly a kiss, that time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And a good smack! Who is there

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> He is more than clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> His wit has wings; you’ll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> This is neither the time nor the place,
you will admit, ladies, to plumb the depths of certain
of those eternal problems and mysterious enigmas
of life and the Beyond which harass and torment
noble souls, like your own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Ah, the “Beyond,” my dear, the “Beyond!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But, aside from this, I am quite at
your service. There is one point, however, which
comes to my mind, a point eternally discussed and
never settled, upon which I ask your leave to say
a few words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> DO, do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> I shall speak, then with a threefold
purpose:—first, to fulfill your request, ladies;
(<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Mme de Loudan</span>) to bring back a
friend who has been led away.——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan</span>, <i class="stage-direction">who
modestly drops her eyes</i>) That is you, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) And to combat an
adversary who has proved exceedingly dangerous—in
more ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> That means Lucy!—It is Lucy!—Lucy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> My subject is—Love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Approving</i>) Ahh!—Ahh!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> For a change!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Bravo!</p>

<p class="dir">(<i class="stage-direction">Low murmurs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) That young lady is feeling
very fit, it seems!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Concerning love!—The weakness
which is a strength!—The sentiment which is a
faith! The only religion, perhaps, which knows no
scoffers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Ah!—Charming!—Charming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To the</i> <span class="smcap">Baroness</span>) Ah, the
wings, my dear—the wings!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> I spoke this morning—in the course of
my lecture on German Literature at the Princess’s—of
a certain philosopher who made instinct
the basis and the rule of all our actions and all our
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Protesting</i>) Oh!—Oh!—Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> And now, ladies, I take occasion emphatically
to declare that that opinion is not my
opinion, and that I deny the theory with every fiber
of my soul and being!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Good! Excellent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan</span>) What
pretty hands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> No, ladies, no! Love is not, as the
German philosopher has it, a purely specific passion;
a deceitful illusion shackling mankind in order
to work its own ends! No, a hundred times no!
if we have souls!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Yes!—Yes—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span>) She is certainly
doing that on purpose!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Leave to the Sophists and to vulgar
natures such soul-stunting theories; do not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
consider them; answer them with silence, the language
of the outcast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Charming!—Charming!——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> God forbid I should go so far as to
deny the sovereign influence of beauty over the uncertain
wills of men! (<i class="stage-direction">Looking about him</i>) I see
too much about me by way of refutation to that
argument!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Ah!—Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>) He looked at <em>her</em>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But above this material and mortal
beauty, there is another, time-defying, invisible to
the naked eye, which the soul of purity serenely
contemplates and cherishes with an unearthly love.
That love, ladies, is the true Love, the mingling of
two spirits, their flight far from the terrestrial
mire—into the infinite blue of the ideal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To herself, rather loudly</i>) Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking at her</i>) That love, mocked
at by some, unknown to most,—I declare, my hand
on my heart, that it does exist! In the souls of the
elect, as Proudhon says——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Protesting</i>) Oh, Proudhon——!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> Oh, Bellac!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> A writer whom I am astonished to find
myself quoting—I beg your pardons! In the souls
of the elect, there is nothing of earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> How delicate! Charming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Bursting forth</i>) Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Oh, Duchess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Bowing to the</i> <span class="smcap">Duchess</span>) And yet, it
exists. Noble spirits have felt it, great poets sung
its praises, and in the seats of Heaven, the apotheosis
of our dreams, we see, enshrined about with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
haloes of ethereal brightness, those immortal figures,
everlasting proof of an undying and psychic
love: Beatrice, Laura——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Laura, the mother of eleven, my dear
Monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Duchess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Eleven! And you call her love
psychic!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Loudan.</span> They were not Petrarch’s,
Duchess; let’s have fair play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Héloise——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Oh, she!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> And their sisters of more recent date:
Elvira, Eloa, and many others, known and unknown.
That cohort of pure and unknown loves, is
growing from day to day—I call all womankind to
witness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Ah, my dear, how true!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> The soul has a language all its own;
its aspirations, its pleasures and its tortures belong
to it: are its very existence. And if it be chained
to the body, it is like the wing of a bird: in order
to raise it to the heights!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies.</span> Ah, bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Rising</i>) This is what modern science
ought to take into consideration—(<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i>
<span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span>) that science which a leaden materialism
drags down to earth—I shall add, since
our venerable master and friend made an allusion
not long since—perhaps a trifle over-hasty—to a
loss which science, I hope, will not have to complain
of—I shall add—(<i class="stage-direction">Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Toulonnier</span>,
<i class="stage-direction">to whom</i> <span class="smcap">Saint-Réault</span> <i class="stage-direction">is speaking</i>) in fine, this is
what <em>he</em> should teach to the youth who have been
under the guidance of Revel, he—whoever he may
be—who will be chosen to carry on the work; and
not only (asking the pardon of our illustrious col<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>league)
upon the insufficient authority vested in
those who have “acquired the right,” or erudition,
or age—ought he to base his claim, but upon the
irresistible power of a mind imbued with the spirit
of youth and of a fiery ardor which is not to be
extinguished!</p>

to do, tell me that? I asked them to begin in there

hear the poet; they’ve begun. Please, what are you

here, and then I’ll see him.</p>

I shall go too! And without saying a word, I’ll
see where they go. And when I see how matters
stand, then and then only, will it be time to act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I am her tutor; it is my duty to look

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> And it was just the same at the convent!
I knew I wasn’t like the other girls. Oh, I
could see that. They always talked to me about
my father and my mother, and why? Because I
didn’t have any! And once, during recess, I was
playing with a girl!—I don’t remember what I’d
done to her—She was furious—and all of a sudden
she called me “Miss Foundling!” She didn’t know
what it meant, neither did I! Her mother had used
the word in speaking about me. She told me afterward,
after we had made up.—Oh, I was so unhappy!
(<i class="stage-direction">Sobbing</i>) We looked the word up in the
dictionary, but we didn’t find anything—or we didn’t
understand—(<i class="stage-direction">Angrily</i>) What did they mean?
What have I done that makes me any different from
anybody else? That everything I do is bad? Is it
my fault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Heavens, the less we are seen the more
we’ll see. Three headaches,—and only one rendezvous!
Aren’t you beginning to see, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> But what I can’t understand is
that Monsieur Bellac——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And what I can’t understand is that
Suzanne——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Oh, she!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> She? Well, you’ll see! They may
come now as soon as they wish: everything’s ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> If Roger finds them here together,
he might——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Bah! Wait till you see! Wait until
you <em>see</em>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> But——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Shh! Didn’t you hear something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Pushing</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Céran</span> <i class="stage-direction">toward
the plant at the right, down-stage</i>) Just in time!—Come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> What, you are going to listen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Hidden</i>) I should think so! There
is nothing else to be done but to listen! There!
In that corner we’ll be snug as weasels. If it becomes
necessary, we can come out, rest assured of
that! Has somebody come in?</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i class="stage-direction">enters quietly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Looking through the branches
which hide her</i>) Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Which of the two?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> <i class="stage-direction">It is she!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Suzanne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> No! She’s not in <i lang="fr">décolletée</i>.
It’s someone else!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Someone else? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> I can’t distinguish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But come on, Paul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> The little Sub-prefect’s wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Again!</p>

<p class="dir">(<span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i class="stage-direction">enters, right, at the back</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What on earth are you doing to that
door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Still in the corner, busied with something</i>)
Necessity is the mother of invention!—I’m
just inventing a little necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> That!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Eh? (<i class="stage-direction">Nervously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Coming in</i>) A great success!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> That! A little burglar alarm I’ve just
installed. Yes, a piece of wood in the door-hinge.
By this means, if anyone should come—oh, not any
one in love,—that would be hardly likely in this
place!—but someone who was trying to take refuge
here and avoid the tragedy—there wouldn’t be any
danger. He gives the door a push, there is a squeak
and we—whht!—by the other door, eh? Isn’t that
a clever invention? I tell you, we statesmen—!
And now, Madame, since we are at last sheltered
from the eyes of the world, I shed the responsibilities
of the public man; the private citizen reappears,
and is ready for the flight of sentiment too
long concealed; I now permit you to call me Paul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, what bliss! You are too good,
P A U L!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> I am good because I am at peace; but,
kissing me in the corridors, you know—the way
you did when you came to unpack my trunk,
that——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside</i>) So it was they!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> And in the garden, this evening, too——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Never again, please! It’s entirely too
imprudent for this house!—And what a place!
Didn’t I tell you? It’s a shame that in order to
become a Prefect one has to yawn himself to death
in this palace of boredom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Céran</span>) Listen to
that! Listen to that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Drawing</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i class="stage-direction">down beside her</i>) Come,
dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sits down, then gets up and walks about,
agitated</i>) What a house! And the hosts, and the
guests, and everybody else! And Madame Arriégo!
And that poet! And the Marquise! And that English
iceberg! And Roger the wooden man! The
Duchess is the only one with any common-sense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> That for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">With conviction</i>) But the rest, oh, my,
oh, my!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> And that for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, come, dear, sit by me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Seating himself, and rising again as before</i>)
And the lectures and the Literature! And
Revel’s candidacy! Clever old fox who keeps dying
every evening and coming back to life every morning!
(<i class="stage-direction">He starts to sit down, then he pauses</i>) And
Saint-Réault! Ah! Saint-Réault! And the <i lang="sa">Ramas-Ravanas</i>
and all the clap-trap about Buddha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Indignantly</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Laughing to herself</i>) Oh, he’s so
funny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> And the other one, he’s a wonder! Bellac
of the many conquests, with his Platonic love!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Dropping her eyes</i>) He’s silly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sitting</i>) Don’t you think so? And that
tragedy! Oh, that tragedy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But, Paul, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> And old Phillippe-Auguste with his beautiful
verse! Why, everybody has written verse!
That’s no reason why he should read it! I’ve done
it myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> You, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Yes, I! When I was a poor student I
even used to sell it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> To a publisher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> No, to a dentist! “Fill-iad, Or the Art
of Filling Teeth.”—Poem in three hundred lines!—Thirty
Francs—Listen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Laughing</i>) Isn’t he amusing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> What nonsense you talk! Who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
ever believe it to see you in the drawing-room!
(<i class="stage-direction">Imitating him</i>) Ah, yes, Monsieur le sénateur, the
tide of democracy—the treaties of 1815—Oh! Oh!
OH!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> And you, dear! You certainly have made
an impression on the hostess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Hmmm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> My compliments!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> But, dearie, I only did what you suggested!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Imitating her</i>) “I only did what you
suggested!”—Ah, little Miss Saintliness with her
little voice! Oh, you filled the Countess full—of
Joubert and Latin and Tocqueville—your own manufacture,
too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> What, her own manufacture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> She is lovely! I like her all the more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Well, I don’t feel any remorse—A woman
who puts us in separate rooms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Rising</i>) And suppose I tell
her to leave!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> Be still!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> And it’s just horrid of her! Yes, she
does it on purpose! A woman knows very well that
new-married people always—have things to say to
each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Tenderly</i>) Yes, always!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Always? Really?—Always like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> What a sweet voice you have! I heard it
a little while ago—talking about the treaties of 1815!
Soft, sweet, all-enveloping. Ah, the voice is the
music of the heart—as Monsieur de Tocqueville
says!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Oh, Paul! I don’t like you to laugh at
such serious things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh, let me be a little nonsensical, please,
dear! I’m so happy here! By Jove, just now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
don’t care a rap whether I’m Prefect of Carcassonne
or not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> It’s always “just now” with me, Monsieur!
That’s the difference!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Dear little wife! (<i class="stage-direction">He kisses her hands</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> But such impropriety, I nev—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> I can’t say that I object to that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> I have a lot of back accounts to settle
before I even begin to collect for the present!
When can we get away? Dear little girl, you don’t
know how I adore you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> Yes, I know—I can judge for myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> My Jeanne!</p>

There she is! Oh, my, how my heart beats! In
cases like this, it’s better to be sure; one can never
tell. Can you see her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Peering out</i>) Yes, it’s she;
Roger will be here in a moment, on the lookout for

this? And your letter this morning? Why did you
write me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Because I wanted to talk with you, my
dear Miss Lucy. Is this the first time we have left
the others and talked, and exchanged ideas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Struggling to control his laughter</i>) Oh,
exchange ideas! I never heard it called that before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Surrounded as I am here, what other
means had I of speaking with you, alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> What other means? You might simply
offer me your arm and leave the room with me.
I’m no French girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But you are in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I may be in France, but I still do as I
please. I have no use for secrets, much less such
mysteries as this! You disguise your handwriting,
you did not sign your name, you even wrote on pink
paper—how French you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) He’s a born villain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No, no! Now see what all your precautions

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Of course; there was no envelope or address——</p>

You see I wasn’t so stupid after all! In any case,
my intentions were good, my dear Miss Lucy. Forgive
your Professor, your friend, and—and—Sit

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I? Not in the least!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Graciously</i>) Very well, but what of

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Simply</i>) Our relations? Friendship!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Playing with the idea</i>) I beg your
pardon! More than friendship, better than love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Well, if it’s more than the one and better

you once more; thank you a thousand times! But
let us go back, shan’t we? (<i class="stage-direction">She starts to go</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Detaining her</i>) Wait a moment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No, no, let us go back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) She won’t take the bait!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Always holding her back</i>) Please wait,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
I beg you!—Two words! Two words! Explain to
me, tell me—it’s worth the trouble! Come, Lucy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Come, Bellac! (<i class="stage-direction">Becoming animated, as
she passes to the right</i>) But see, my friend, listen,
M. Bellac—your Platonic love has absolutely no
philosophical basis——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Pardon me, that love is a kind of friendship——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> If it’s friendship it is no longer love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But it’s a double concept!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> If it’s double, it cannot be a unit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But there is a fusion! (<i class="stage-direction">He seats himself</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> If it is a fusion, it has no longer an individuality.
I’ll explain my meaning! (<i class="stage-direction">She seats
herself</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) She’s swallowed the hook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I deny that any fusion is possible between
love, which is based upon indivisibility, and friendship,
which is largely composed of sympathy; that
is to say, that in which the Ego becomes, in a way,
the Non-Ego. I deny absolutely, absolutely——!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran</span>) I have often
heard people talk about love, but never that way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But, Lucy——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But, Bellac—Yes or no, the principal factor——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> But, Lucy—Here’s an example: suppose
two beings, two abstractions, two entities—any
man, any woman,—who love each other, but with
an ordinary physiological love—you follow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Perfectly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Let us suppose these two in the following
circumstances; they are alone at night, together—what
would happen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Céran</span>) I don’t
know, do you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Without fail—now pay close attention—without
fail, this phenomenon will take place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) It’s so funny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Do you think so, Madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Both of them, or more probably, one of
them, the man——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) The male entity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Would approach her whom he believes
he loves—(<i class="stage-direction">He approaches her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Drawing back a little</i>) But——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Gently holding her</i>) No, no, you’ll
see! They gaze fixedly into each other’s eyes, she
feels his breath on her cheek, her hair brushes
against his face——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But, M. Bellac——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> And then—and then, their Egoes mingle,
independently of the Ego itself, an uninterrupted
series of involuntary acts which, by a natural
succession, progressing slowly and inevitably, hurls
them, if I may be permitted the expression, into the
maelstrom which, though foreseen, cannot be
avoided—in which Reason and Soul are powerless!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> One moment! This process——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Listen, listen! Suppose now another
couple and another love: a psychological, not a
physiological love—an exception; you still follow
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> These two, seated side by side, come
nearer to each other——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Drawing away</i>) But that’s the very
same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Bringing her back</i>) Listen to me; there
is the slightest shade of difference. Let me illustrate:
they too gaze into each other’s eyes and they
too——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Well? (<i class="stage-direction">She rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Making her sit down</i>) But—but—They
are oblivious of physical beauty: it is their
souls which commune. They no longer hear each
other’s voices, but rather the palpitation of their
thoughts! And then, finally, by an entirely different
process—though springing from the same source—they
too arrive at that obscure and turbulent state
of mind in which the being is ignorant even of its
own existence—a delicious atrophy of the Will
which seems the <i lang="la">summum</i> and the <i lang="la">terminus</i> of human
happiness; they leave the earth to awaken in
a free Heaven, for <em>their</em> love transports them far
above the murky clouds of earthly passion into the
pure Ether of the sublimely Ideal! (<i class="stage-direction">A pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>) They’re going to kiss!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Lucy!! Dear Lucy, don’t you understand?
Say that you understand me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Troubled</i>) But—it seems to me that
these two concepts——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Oh, the concepts! That’s too much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> The two concepts are identical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Passionately</i>) Identical?! Oh, Lucy,
you are cruel! Identical! You must understand
that in this case it is entirely subjective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Subjective! Oh, I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Growing more excited</i>) Subjective!
Lucy! You must understand me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Greatly moved</i>) But, Bellac—subjective!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>) He’ll never kiss her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul.</span> Then I’ll kiss you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Astonished; rising</i>) What’s this?
Are they kissing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Someone—someone’s there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Come, take my hand!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> There’s someone listening! I’m sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellac.</span> Come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. de Céran.</span> Oh, it was Bellac’s letter to

Marry her if you want;—but you shouldn’t have

shouldn’t have—— (<i class="stage-direction">Throwing herself in his arms</i>)
You shouldn’t have! Oh, don’t marry her! Don’t
marry her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Oh, my dear Suzanne! How happy I
am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Then that letter you found wasn’t sent
to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> To me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I didn’t send it—I swear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I swear! It was sent to Lucy by Bellac!
Now I understand: you thought—just as I did—— Oh,
I see everything now!—Oh, my dear Suzanne,
what an awful fright you gave me! It was fearful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> But what about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> What about? Oh—it’s absurd—don’t ask—it
was base of me. Forgive me, I beg you, forgive
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Then you’re not going to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But I’m telling you——!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Then I don’t understand at all. Only
tell me you won’t marry her, and I’ll believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Of course I won’t. What a child you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
are! Don’t cry, wipe your eyes, my dear Suzanne,
there’s nothing to cry about!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I can’t help it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I have only you in the world! I don’t
want you to leave me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Leave you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Sobbing</i>) You know how jealous I
am. You—you can’t understand that! I saw this
evening, when I tried to make you jealous by talking
with M. Bellac, that you didn’t seem to care at
all. You didn’t care anything about me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I wanted to kill him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> To kill him? (<i class="stage-direction">Puts her arms around
his neck</i>) How nice you are! Then you thought—?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Let’s not say any more about that, it’s
all over, forgotten, the past is dead. Let’s begin
all over again: from my arrival—How are you,
Suzanne? How are you, dear? It’s been so long
since I’ve seen you! Come to me, dear, the way you
used to! (<i class="stage-direction">He seats himself with her beside him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> Oh, Roger, how nice you are! What
lovely things you say! You love me better than you
love her, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">With feeling</i>) Love you! But isn’t
it my duty to love you? As a relative, as a tutor,
as an honest man? Love you! When I read that
letter I don’t know what happened to me—then I
understood how deep my feelings were—yes, I love
you, my dear child, my divine creature! More than
I ever imagined I did! And I want you to know—(<i class="stage-direction">Tenderly</i>)—don’t
you feel that I love you deeply,
dear little Suzanne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">A little surprised at his vehemence</i>)
Yes—Roger——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> The way you look at me—I frightened
you—you don’t believe me—I’m not used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>—I’m
not used to saying tender things, I’m awkward—I
don’t know how to say those things—one’s emotions
are influenced by maternal training and you know
my mother; she has made a dryasdust scientist of
me. Science has been my sole preoccupation—You
have been my sole distraction—the one ray of sunshine
in my dreary youth. You have only me and
I have only you—and I, my dear child, whom else
have I to love but you?—And I didn’t know! You
have charmed me as one is charmed by a child!—With
your simplicity, with your grace! I was your
teacher, but your pupil as well. While I was nursing
your mind to blossom forth into thought, you
were planting seeds of tenderness in my heart. I
taught you to read, you taught me to—love! It was
your tiny pink fingers, the silk of your golden hair
that woke my heart to its first kisses! You crept
into my heart then, and you have grown now until
your soul has filled mine! (<i class="stage-direction">Pause</i>) Now do you
believe me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Moved, she rises and speaks in a low
voice</i>) Let’s go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Why?—Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Troubled</i>) Away from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> It’s so dark!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But, just a moment ago——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> A moment ago I didn’t see what you
meant——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, stay, stay! There’s no better place
than this. I have so much to tell you. My heart
is so full! I don’t know why I tell you all this—It’s
true—It’s so good to say these things—Ah,
Suzanne—stay! Dear Suzanne—(<i class="stage-direction">He holds her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> I don’t know, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> You’re crying! Have I hurt you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Have I offended you, without knowing
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> No, no,—I don’t know. I don’t understand.
Please, let’s go away from here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> My dear children, how happy you
make me! Go on, kiss your bride!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Not understanding at first</i>) My bride—Suzanne!

Ohh! It’s true,—I love her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">Joyously</i>) Nonsense! Even when
it’s as clear as day? (<i class="stage-direction">To</i> <span class="smcap">Suzanne</span>) And how

<p><span class="smcap">Suzanne.</span> (<i class="stage-direction">With downcast eyes</i>) Oh, Aunt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span> It seemed—that you could see all the

eh? That idea of mine to turn down the gas was
splendid. So everything’s going nicely now? Well,
there is only your mother to see!</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
